The text for this class is\u00a0[_Differential Geometry, Lie Groups and Symmetric Spaces_](http://www.ams.org/bookstore?fn=20&arg1=gsmseries&item=GSM-34) by Sigurdur Helgason (American Mathematical Society, 2001).\n\nMuch of the course material is based on Chapter\u00a0I (first half) and Chapter\u00a0II of the text. The text however develops basic Riemannian Geometry, Complex Manifolds, as well as a detailed theory of Semisimple Lie Groups and Symmetric Spaces.\n",
