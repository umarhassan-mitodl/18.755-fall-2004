Course Description
------------------

After a historical motivation of the definition of a Lie group we shall develop basic manifold theory, vector fields, tangent spaces leading to the Exponential mapping for an affine connection. The exponential mapping for a Lie group emerges as a special case. The relationship between Lie subgroups and Lie subalgebras via the exponential mapping will be developed in detail. Lie's three fundamental theorems relating **all** finite-dimensional Lie algebras with local Lie groups will be proved via Maurer-Cartan forms and the global version by means of the Levi-decomposition. We conclude with a study of invariant differential forms on Lie groups and coset spaces, ending with some results about cohomology of Lie groups.

Textbook
--------

Helgason, Sigurdur. [_Differential Geometry, Lie Groups, and Symmetric Spaces_](http://www.ams.org/bookstore?fn=20&arg1=gsmseries&item=GSM-34). Providence, R.I.: American Mathematical Society, 2001. ISBN: 0821828487.

Prerequisites
-------------

These are [18.100B](/courses/18-100b-analysis-i-fall-2010) (Analysis and Metric Spaces) and 18.700 (Linear Algebra). The course [18.101](/courses/18-101-analysis-ii-fall-2005) (Calculus in Several Variables) would be useful and some familiarity with topological groups is also helpful.

Grading
-------

There are no scheduled tests and no final exam. The course is graded on the basis of homework assignments. Many other problems are suggested during the term.
